# NMF-DR
### Motivation: 
Drug repurposing is a potential alternative to the traditional drug discovery process. Drug
repurposing can be formulated as a recommender system that recommends novel indications for available
drugs based on known drug-disease associations. This paper presents a method based on non-negative
matrix factorization (NMF-DR) to predict the drug-related candidate disease indications. This work
proposes a recommender system-based method for drug repurposing (NMF-DR) to predict novel drug
indications by integrating drug and diseases related data sources.For this purpose, this framework first
integrates two types of disease similarities, the associations between drugs and diseases, and the
various similarities between drugs from different views to make a heterogeneous drug-disease interaction
network. Then, an improved non-negative matrix factorization-based method is proposed to complete the
drug-disease adjacency matrix with predicted scores for unknown drug-disease pairs.
### Results: 
The comprehensive experimental results show NMF-DR achieves superior prediction
performance than several existing methods for drug-disease association prediction.
