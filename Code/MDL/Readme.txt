The algorithms for performing MDL to estimate the subspace size are called from CallMDLAlgorithms. The input requirements are an input matrix, the r values as a column vector, a collection (in a column cell) of Ws and Hs (separately) for each respective r value, and the precision of the data. In addition, for the set thresholds there needs to be a value set between 0 and 1, which decides on the threshold with, 1 means all values that fall into the bottow bin are classed as zeros, while 0 means the zero terms are not used at all. The options is a struct with choices about whether to plot each of a range of graphs.
